General Overview:
EZAUCR Arrest Statistics provides comprehensive arrest data compiled from U.S. law enforcement agencies across years and states. It includes arrest counts by offense type, population coverage, and category-level crime breakdowns. These insights are critical for criminal justice analytics, resource allocation, and policy evaluations.

Research Questions
Question 1:
Out of robbery, fraud, or murder, which crime decreased the most at a nationwide level over 20 years? To what extent?
Why it is important:
Seeing different crime trends helps evaluate how effective crime prevention programs are and how societal behaviors are changing. From an economic standpoint, crimes impose costs and reductions in crime can save public resources that can be used to improve society in other areas. Trends can be studied to determine which crimes have the greatest economic impact. Policywise, lawmakers are able to assess which policies are working and where resources need to be shifted to prevent  further damages based on the crime. Policies supporting the reduction of the crime that’s decreased the most over the last 20 years can be used as a model to decrease other crimes.
